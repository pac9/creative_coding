# creative_coding
Using java in processing development environment as part of final project as educational establishment Codeclan and formed 
part of a presentation made to the class on 26th July 2018.

The sketches are setup to run in the Processing development environment with the code written in Java, 
see https://processing.org/

Where I have taken other people's code and added to it, which is part of the learning objective, this has been 
written onto the lead pde file of each sketch.  

All sketches have been setup to run at full screen therefore to get out of the sketches press escape. You can change the 
size at which the sketches run in the setup by removing fullscreen and putting in size(width, height) where
width and height are figures determined by you.

On a few of pdes as I've making a lot of comments, I have shown both the code both with comments and without. 

For the shapes.pde, I showed more examples that that uploaded here such as spirals and moving bubbles. These were based 
on sketches which were provided on a futurelearn course(www.futurelearn.com) in relation to creative coding 
which I has previously undertaken therefore I have not uploaded these. The futurelearn course has been discontinued but other 
examples of moving shapes can be found in the 'Examples' sections of the PDE and at https://processing.org/examples/
